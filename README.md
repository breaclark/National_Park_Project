In this project I plot all the national parks on a map, showing each of their most popular seasons. 

All of the national park data used is from https://irma.nps.gov. Specifially, 
https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Annual%20Recreation%20Visitation%20By%20Park%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)
and
https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Recreation%20Visitors%20By%20Month%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)?Park=ACAD
The zip codes used here are from google. 

Read nat_parks.ipynb if you'd like to know more about how I got all the information together and formatted it.
If you just want to look at the graphs, check out Plotting the Parks.ipynb
